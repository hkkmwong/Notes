## Introduction

Every child has a right to protection against any forms of harm or exploitation, and child maltreatment/abuse should be prevented and, if occurred, be intervened promptly to prevent further harm or risk to the child involved.

Anyone coming across a suspected child maltreatment case should intervene or, at the very least, report to appropriate authorities for intervention.

Laymen and practitioners of different professions may not be able to distinguish which cases would require immediate and what extent of intervention.  Multi-disciplinary co-operation involving trained social workers and relevant professionals would be the most appropriate approach for investigating, classifying and arranging intervention and treatment for the reported cases.  Reference may be made to the *“Protecting Children from Maltreatment - Procedural Guide for Multi-disciplinary Co-operation (Revised 2020)” (“Procedural Guide”)*.

Some professions have required their practitioners to report suspected child maltreatment cases to Police and SWD, and other only reported these cases on a voluntary basis.  Yet, there were times when unreported serious cases that have led to tragedies due to failure of early reporting and interventions.  These tragedies may have been prevented if reporting has taken place earlier.


## Background

The Chief Executive announced in his 2022 Policy Address that the Government would take forward the setting up of mandatory reporting regime for child abuse cases to enhance the protection for children.  At the meeting of the Executive Council on 23 May 2023, the
Council ADVISED and the Chief Executive ORDERED that the [Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Bill (“Bill”)](https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/council/bills.html?bill_key=10001&session=2024) should be introduced into the Legislative Council (“LegCo”).  The Bill was gazatted on 2 June 2023 and introduced to LegCo on 14 June 2023.  In the legislative proposal, professionals who have frequent contacts with the children during the course of work should be required to make mandatory report of child abuse.  A list of the practitioners is to be designated as Mandated Reporters (“MRs”) come from social welfare sector, education sector and healthcare sector.  It is proposed that mandated reporters should be required to make a report if they have reasonable grounds to suspect that a child "is suffering serious harm" or "is at real risk of suffering serious harm" during their course of work and pertaining to their scope of professional practice. 

The Bills Committee on the Bill held its first meeting on 25 July 2023 and completed its scrutiny work at it ninth (9th) meeting on 1 June 2024.  After reporting to the [House Committee](https://www.legco.gov.hk/yr2024/english/hc/agenda/hc20240621.htm) of LegCo on **21 June 2024 (Fri)**, the Bill was put up for Second Reading (debate to resume) and consideration by committee of the whole Council and Third Reading on 10 July 2024 (Wed) and was passed at the [LegCo meeting](https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/council/council-meetings.html#schedule&cm20240710) on **11 July 2024 (Thu)**.  The **Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance (“MRCAO”)** (“Ordinance”) was gazetted on 19 July 2024 (Fri) and will take effect after 18 months, i.e. 20 January 2026 (Tue).  According to the Hong Kong e-Legislation [Chapter Number Index](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/index/chapternumber?TYPE=1&TYPE=2&TYPE=3&LANGUAGE=E), the Ordinance has been assigned as [Chapter 650](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap650).

The MRCAO, Cap. 650, requires Specified Professionals who have frequent contacts with children to report suspected child maltreatment cases to the Authority, i.e. HKPF and SWD, as soon as practicable.  Failure may be an offence and result in criminal proceedings and penalty.
